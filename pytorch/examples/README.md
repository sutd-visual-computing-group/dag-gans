# Data Augmentation optimized for GAN (DAG)

We provide the implementations on BigGAN backbone and preliminary comparison to concurrent work, [Data-Efficient GANs with DiffAugment](https://github.com/mit-han-lab/data-efficient-gans). We also provide some examples of how to integrate our pytorch DAG module in existing GAN models, e.g., [WGAN-GP](https://github.com/caogang/wgan-gp)
